# CSC372PopularLanguages
Reports the results of what languages the students of 372 think are the most popular
I have redacted the names of all the students becuase this repository is public.
This includes the input file and the stusents.txt output file.
The only file this project contains is the PopularLanguages.txt file, which contains the number of votes for each language.
